                    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                    <p class="ourstoryp">As with many beautiful love stories, ours began with Rhodes hockey. Bren was the coach, only known by his pseudonym
                        ‘the Nighthawk’. Nina was the sarcastic first year with a knack for injuries.</p>
                    <p class="ourstoryp">It took a while, and several first dates (it depends who you ask) but eventually we were meeting parents, trekking
                        over mountains, and snorkelling through seas. We managed to endure our (very) long distance and became very good at
                        navigating South Africa’s airports. While Bren tackled Durban traffic and hit sixes, Nina dived into her Masters in
                        Knysna. Sharing a love for wildlife and adventure we took every opportunity to visit our favourite places together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ourstoryp">We travelled many miles and when Nina got a job offer in Oxford, we started our next adventure. We’ve slowly been
                        building our life with IKEA furniture and learning just how many ways there are to say “it’s raining”. When Bren
                        (finally) proposed, with the backdrop of the English lakes (and of course light rain), it had to be a yes from Nina.
